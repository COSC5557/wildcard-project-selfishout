# Wildcard Project

You have a cool idea for a machine learning project? Use this repository. Make
sure to explain what problem you're solving and how you're doing it.

# Intro
In this volunteer exercise, I'm going to use the Breast Cancer Dataset. In this dataset features get from digitized images of breast mass.

The aim is to use a method in Explainable AI, called Shapley Value, to make the model prediction more robust and interpretable to other practitioners like doctors. Continue on the pdf file.
